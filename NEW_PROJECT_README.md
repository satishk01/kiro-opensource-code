### Installation

1. **Clone or copy the enhanced files**:
   ```bash
   # The new files are:
   # - new_project_app.py
   # - services/enhanced_file_service.py
   # - services/enhanced_ai_service.py
   # - run_new_project.py
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit boto3 pathlib
   ```

3. **Optional dependencies for native dialogs**:
   ```bash
   # For Windows/Linux (usually included with Python)
   pip install tkinter
   
   # For Linux systems, you might need:
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk zenity  # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo yum install tkinter zenity         # CentOS/RHEL
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Method 1: Using the launcher script
```bash
python run_new_project.py
```

#### Method 2: Direct streamlit command
```bash
streamlit run new_project_app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## üìÅ Enhanced Folder Selection

### Native Folder Browser
Click the "üóÇÔ∏è Open Folder Browser" button to use your operating system's native folder selection dialog:

- **Windows**: Uses Windows Explorer folder dialog
- **macOS**: Uses Finder folder selection
- **Linux**: Uses zenity, kdialog, or yad (falls back to tkinter)

### Manual Path Entry
Enter the full path to your project folder:
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Projects\MyProject`
- macOS/Linux: `/home/user/projects/myproject`

### ZIP File Upload
Upload your project as a ZIP file:
- Drag and drop or browse for ZIP files
- Automatic extraction with progress tracking
- Security validation to prevent malicious files

### Recent Projects
Quick access to your recently used project folders for faster workflow.

## üéØ Coding Standards Integration

### Auto-Detection
The system automatically detects coding standards from your project:
- **Linting configurations**: ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop
- **Formatting tools**: Prettier, Black, EditorConfig
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest, Pytest, RSpec
- **Documentation standards**: README, contribution guidelines

### Manual Configuration
Add custom coding standards in the "Coding Standards" section:
1. Select a category (Code Style, Architecture, Testing, etc.)
2. Enter your standard or guideline
3. Standards are automatically applied to spec generation

### Standards-Aware Features
- **Codebase Analysis**: Analysis considers your coding standards
- **Requirements Generation**: Requirements align with your standards
- **Design Documents**: Designs follow your architectural guidelines
- **Compliance Reports**: Get reports on standards compliance

3. **Linux**: Install dialog tools: `sudo apt-get install zenity`

### File Access Issues
If you can't access certain folders:
1. Check file permissions
2. Ensure the path exists and is readable
3. Try running with appropriate permissions

### AI Service Issues
If AI features don't work:
