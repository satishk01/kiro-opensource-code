# 📁 Direct Folder Picker - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **Exactly What You Requested!**

You asked for folder selection that works **"similar to ZIP file upload where we can select a folder so that all files in that folder are automatically selected."**

✅ **DELIVERED!** The new "📁 Select Folder (Direct)" tab provides exactly this functionality.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Just Like ZIP File Selection:**

3. **Select entire folder** (instead of selecting a ZIP file)
4. **All files automatically included** (just like extracting a ZIP)
5. **Ready to use!** (same workflow as ZIP)

### **The Magic:**
- Uses HTML5 `webkitdirectory` attribute
- Transforms regular file uploader into folder picker
- Preserves complete folder structure
- Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
