        ### **Issue: "Invalid ZIP file"**
        **Solutions:**
        - Ensure file has .zip extension
        - Try creating ZIP file again using different method
        - Check if file is corrupted by opening it locally
        
        ### **Issue: "Security risk detected"**
        **Solutions:**
        - ZIP contains dangerous file paths (../ or absolute paths)
        - Recreate ZIP from your project folder directly
        - Avoid using ZIP files from untrusted sources
        
        ### **Issue: "Extraction failed"**
        **Solutions:**
        - ZIP file might be corrupted - try creating it again
        - File might be too large - try smaller ZIP (under 100MB)
        - Check available disk space
        
        ### **Issue: "No files found after extraction"**
        **Solutions:**
        - ZIP might be empty - check contents before upload
        - Files might be in nested folders - check extraction path
        - Permission issues - ensure files are readable
        
        ### **Best Practices:**
        ✅ Create ZIP from project root folder (not parent folder)
        ✅ Use standard ZIP compression (not RAR, 7z, etc.)
        ✅ Keep ZIP files under 100MB for best performance
        ✅ Avoid special characters in folder/file names
        ✅ Test ZIP file locally before uploading
